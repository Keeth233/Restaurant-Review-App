# Restaurant-Review-App

## Project
For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

## Project Objectives
* Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .
Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; ```all responsiveness should be done with CSS.```
* Use appropriate document type declaration and ```viewport tags```
* Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
* Use ```media queries``` that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
* Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
* Implement ```accessibility features``` in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).
* Add a ```ServiceWorker script``` to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.

## To Run
* Clone/Download and extract to computer.
* Using ```cmd/terminal``` from inside the folder directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 
_with version 2.x.x of python installed, use_ ```Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` and
_with version 3.x.x of python installed, use_ ```Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000```.
You can discover the installed version of Python you have by running ```python -V``` at the command line.
*You can download from https://www.python.org/downloads/ if not installed on your system.
* After Launching local server, Visit the site in your browser at ```http://localhost:8000```
_Port 8000 may be changed to your choice
